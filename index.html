    <p>Hi, My name is Paolo Romulus O. Barbosa. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I was born in 2000 from Manila</li>
      <li>20 years old</li>
      <li>College Student</li>
      <li>Male</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since when I was young I really love to explore and play video games.</p>
    <p>The reason why I chose this course because I wanted to know more about technologies but honestly not programming.</p>
    <p>To be honest I really wanted to drop out in College due to some confidential reasons but I love my parents and I don't want them to be disappointed</p>
    <p> I don't want to brag my skills or talents because I want to express not to impress </p>

<h3> My Friends </h3>

 <p> These guys are my bestfriends and the real ones that you will ever meet. </p>
 
<h3> Pets </h3>
<p> I really love having pets when I was a kid but I constantly got heartbreaks because they died year after years had passed but my family had 2 pets right now.</p>
<p> I have no photos of them because I was a kid before and my parents were too busy to took picture </p>
